# todo-api

ðŸ“ƒ a RESTful API to allow users to manage their to-do list.
This project is one of which is in the [roadmap.sh back-end project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/todo-list-api). Me and [ME-Atish](https://github.com/ME-Atish) are contributing to build this project, but you may find the project in [Community Solutions](https://roadmap.sh/projects/todo-list-api/solutions) under my profile.

If you want to use this API, we designed a CLI tool called [todo-cli](https://github.com/LittleOddBoy/todo-cli). Check that out!
